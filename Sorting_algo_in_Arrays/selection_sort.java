	/**
	 * what's the selection sort??? 
	 * answer : Selection sort is a simple sorting
	 * algorithm. This sorting algorithm is an in-place comparison-based algorithm
	 * in which the list is divided into two parts, the sorted part at the left end
	 * and the unsorted part at the right end. Initially, the sorted part is empty
	 * and the unsorted part is the entire list.
	 * 
	 * The smallest element is selected from the unsorted array and swapped with the
	 * leftmost element, and that element becomes a part of the sorted array. This
	 * process continues moving unsorted array boundary by one element to the right.
	 * 
	 * This algorithm is not suitable for large data sets as its average and worst
	 * case complexities are of ÎŸ(n2), where n is the number of items.
	 *
